# Shared Content

:::{note}
:name: note-launcher

The rocket button ðŸš€ can be used to open a specific page in a properly-configured BinderHub or JupyterHub. This can be used to explore published content in a fully-fledged editor (such as vscode, or JupyterLab), or access particular data-storage.

:::{hint} Why does Binder take so long to launch?
:name: hint-binder

Binder is a great tool for sharing code and data, but it can be slow to start up. This is because Binder needs to build an image to provide the software environment that includes all of the dependencies needed to run your notebooks. The first time you use Binder, this process takes longer than usual. Subsequent launches are faster as the image is cached on the cloud and does not need to be rebuilt.
